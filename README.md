Generates static image galleries

Take a simple folder, `pics`,  containing

* pics/IMG_2012.JPG

I'd like to include:

* pics/IMG_2012.xmp
* pics/IMG_2012.yml

Additionally, there will need to be a `properties.yml` (similar to [gus](https://github.com/jimktrains/gus)) file in the root dir describing how to create the static indexes, sizes to resize to, templates, &c
